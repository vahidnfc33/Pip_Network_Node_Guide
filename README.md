# **Pipe POP Node Setup Guide**

Welcome to the **Pipe POP Node Setup**! This guide will walk you through the entire process of setting up your Pipe POP node, including configuring automatic startup using `systemd`, and utilizing the referral and reputation systems to earn rewards.

---

## **üñ•Ô∏è Requirements**

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

- A **Linux system** (Ubuntu is recommended)
- The **`pop` binary** file that was sent to you via email

---

## **‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions**

### **1. Create the Working Directory**

Let's begin by creating the directory where your `pop` node files will reside, and a separate directory for the cache:

```bash
mkdir -p /root/pipenetwork
mkdir -p /root/pipenetwork/download_cache
cd /root/pipenetwork
```

**üîî Important:** After creating the `pipenetwork` directory, move the **`pop` binary** that you received via email into this directory.

---

### **2. Set Up the Systemd Service**

Now we‚Äôll configure the systemd service to manage the Pipe POP node automatically.

1. **Create the systemd service file** at `/etc/systemd/system/pipe-pop.service` with the following content:

    ```ini
    [Unit]
    Description=Pipe POP Node Service
    After=network.target
    Wants=network-online.target

    [Service]
    User=root
    Group=root
    WorkingDirectory=/root/pipenetwork
    ExecStart=/root/pipenetwork/pop \
        --ram <Your RAM size> \
        --max-disk <Your server disk max> \
        --cache-dir /root/pipenetwork/download_cache \
        --pubKey <Your Solana Address> \
        --signup-by-referral-route dmhkLmdvb2
    Restart=always
    RestartSec=5
    LimitNOFILE=65536
    LimitNPROC=4096
    StandardOutput=journal
    StandardError=journal
    SyslogIdentifier=dcdn-node

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

   **üåü Explanation of the Parameters**:
   - `--ram <Your RAM size>`: Replace `<Your RAM size>` with the amount of RAM you wish to allocate (e.g., `8` for 8GB).
   - `--max-disk <Your server disk max>`: Replace `<Your server disk max>` with the disk space you want to allocate (e.g., `500` for 500GB).
   - `--pubKey <Your Solana Address>`: Replace `<Your Solana Address>` with your actual Solana public address.

### **3. Enable and Start the Service**

Once your systemd service file is created, it‚Äôs time to enable and start the service to ensure it runs automatically on boot:

1. **Reload systemd** to apply the changes:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

2. **Enable the service** to start on boot:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable pipe-pop
    ```

3. **Start the service**:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start pipe-pop
    ```

---

### **4. Verify the Service**

To make sure the service is running smoothly, use the following command to check its status:

```bash
sudo systemctl status pipe-pop
```

---

### **5. Monitoring and Logs**

You can monitor the logs and the real-time status of your node by running:

```bash
journalctl -u pipe-pop -f
```

---

### **6. Check Your Node's Reputation and Points**

To check your node's performance, reputation, and points earned from referrals, use the following command:

```bash
./pop --status
```

You‚Äôll get a detailed breakdown of your node‚Äôs reputation metrics, including:

- **Uptime Score** (40% of total)
- **Egress Score** (30% of total)
- **Historical Score** (30% of total)

---

### **7. Generate Your Referral Code**

Want to share your referral code and earn points? Use the following command to generate your unique referral code:

```bash
./pop --gen-referral-route
```

Once generated, you can share this referral code with others who can sign up and join your network!
